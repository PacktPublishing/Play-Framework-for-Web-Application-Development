## About the Video Course
Java programming with Spring, Spring MVC, JSP, Tiles, and Hibernate, among others, has become very tedious. It requires developers to write hundreds of lines of code configuration. The Play! Framework provides a solution for this by removing the boilerplate, making application development more productive and time efficient.

In "Play! Framework for Web Application Development" you will learn how to use Play! 2 to create robust web applications. You will create an agenda application and make it better by adding functionality with each progressing tutorial. By the end of this course, you’ll have the confidence to create awesome applications with the Play! Framework.

If you have always wanted to learn how to create great Java web applications then this course is for you. This friendly, hands-on course will show you how to overcome the inherent complexity in writing Java web applications by leveraging the Play! Framework.

The course starts by showing you how to create a basic agenda application. You’ll then add validations, internationalization, and custom error pages before enhancing it using the popular frontend framework, Twitter Bootstrap. Additionally you’ll learn how to create modules to re-utilize code for future projects. You’ll finish the course by adding a JSON API to your application so that it can consume Twitter’s API using async requests.

By the end of Play! Framework for Web Application Development you will be a more confident developer able to create attractive, fast, and scalable applications using the Play! Framework.




This course teaches you the key aspects of this flexible data store. You’ll learn how a NoSQL data store such as Redis differs from traditional SQL databases that you may be more familiar with. You’ll see how to install the database on your own machine, or use a database provider in the cloud. You’ll also discover the basic native data types of Redis and how to use them.

From theory to application, Rapid Redis explains when, why, and how to use the Redis data store. We’ll discuss the differences between NoSQL and SQL, explore the Redis data types to see how to use them, and end up with an easy-to-understand Node.js example app that uses Redis as a cache.

No matter what kind of application you’re working on, you need a place to store your data. Rapid Redis gives you a new tool to add to your toolbox: a data store that is quick and easy to use, and far more powerful than you can imagine.
